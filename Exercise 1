# Exercise 1: 



# from collections import Counter

# #TO find how much word will be shown
# int1 = int(input("Words number: "))

# word = [list(map(str, input("write word: ").split())) for _ in range(int1)]

# it will extract first elements from wors wich is readen from visitor
# words = [x[0] for x in word]

# it will print unique words 
# print(len(Counter(words).keys()))

# it will count words by creating ist of frequencies
# val = list(Counter(words).values())
# listToStr = ' '.join([str(elem) for elem in val])
# print(listToStr)
